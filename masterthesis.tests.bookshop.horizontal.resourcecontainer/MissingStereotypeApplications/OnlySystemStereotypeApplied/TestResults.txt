ASSERT [error] failed at (DynamicHorizontalScalingResourceContainerPreconditions.qvto:66) : There is no replicable Resource Container, hence the number of replicas cannot be tested.
ASSERT [error] failed at (DynamicHorizontalScalingResourceContainerPreconditions.qvto:78) : There is no replicable Resource Container, hence the scale in threshold cannot be tested.
ASSERT [error] failed at (DynamicHorizontalScalingResourceContainerPreconditions.qvto:91) : There is no replicable Resource Container, hence the scale out threshold cannot be tested.
ASSERT [error] failed at (DynamicHorizontalScalingResourceContainerPreconditions.qvto:111) : There is no Replicable ResourceContainer, hence scale in greater than scale out cannot be tested.
